Thinking in binary

We have ten fingers, so we think numbers are all about the powers of ten:
1
10
100
1000
10000
etc.
Each power of 10 adds a decimal digit
Multiplying or dividing by 10 just shifts the digits
It's weird, but we're used to it

Mechanical calculators are built this way

Computers only have two fingers
It's ones and zeros because digital signals are either on or off
Simplification of the "real" world!

It's all about the powers of 2

Binary numbers (base 2)
0	   0
1	   1
2	  10
3	  11
4	 100
5	 101
6	 110
7	 111
8	1000
9	1001
...
15	1111
16	10000
...
31	11111
32	100000
...
65535	1111111111111111
Each power of two adds another binary digit
Multiplying or dividing by 2 is just shifting the numbers

Binary values represent two things:
Data: Numbers, alphabetical characters, database records, etc.
Instructions: that tell the processor what to do - Add, subtract, move, copy, load, store
 
You need more transistors to move more bits

What is the size of an instruction?
How many different instructions do we need?
VAX-11	243
8086	81

What is the size of a unit of data?  
How many different values do we need?

To talk about
The temperature of your house
All of your pets
Books on a shelf
Books in a library
Equations to solve an N-degree polynomial
people in a meeting
The number of dollars in your bank account
The wealth of a nation
The number of contacts in a phone list
The number of airplane flights on a given day
The number of hurricanes in a year
The number of items in your shopping cart
The number of radar inputs on a self-driving car
The number of files on a disk drive
The number of (visible) stars in the sky
Elements in a finite-element model
Structural members in a bridge
Transistors in a CPU

All the people in the US
All the people who have ever lived

Needs vary, and so do CPUs!

Smaller numbers, fewer instructions = Cheaper
Bigger numbers, more instructions = Expensive

Example:  
8-bit microcontroller suitable for a thermostat - 1 USD
Example:  
32-bit microprocessor suitable for a car - 100 USD
Example:
64-bit, 6 core midrange CPU for your laptop - 150+ USD

How can we write code for these?
Generally we trust a compiler to remember these things
Soooo Many C/C++ compilers!
But all tested to the standard

The Standard Says:

The fundamental unit is the Byte
Must be big enough to represent a character
there 96 characters used in C/C++ programming

But not all bytes are created equal

The 8-bit byte is queen

Each byte in memory is individually addressable

But not all addresses are created equal!

Very compact!  Yay!

Similarly, a computer is more efficient when it can fetch larger chunks at a time

"Word size" is the unit of storage that a CPU would prefer to fetch due to its hardware 
Memory accesses are often done along word boundaries

16-bit machine
32-bit machine
64-bit machine

Accessing a byte is not as fast
