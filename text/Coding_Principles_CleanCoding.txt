Clean Code

TODO List:

Clean Code

Is easier to read
Offers fewer places for bugs to hide
Highlights your programming language natural constructs

A place for everything
Each line of code has a place where it would be best
Every variable has a place where it is best declared and used

Think of your future self
How will you find things you wrote
How will you recognize them
How will you fix them

How to tell Clean Code

Follows conventions
Clear names for everything
Short functions
Appropriate abstractions
Appropriate algorithms
Follow your organization's conventions



What to Avoid:

Meaningless comments
Comments that are likely to be wrong later
Cut-and-paste coding
Duplication of code, algorithms, concepts

Code Smells

Lean on Your Tools

Formatting
Spelling
Renaming
Refactoring
Standards Compliance
Functional Testing
Characterization
Organization of source
