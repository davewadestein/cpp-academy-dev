Complex Numbers

#include <complex>


Pseudorandom Numbers

Why "pseudo"?

Because they are generated algorithmically
Generator is usually seeded with a value to start it
Same seed produces same sequence of pseudorandom numbers
Useful for writing repeatable tests

"Truly" random numbers come from physical processes
Radioactive decay
Thermal noise
Other quantum effects

Old way:

#include <cstdlib>

int random_integer = std::rand();

Where's the PI?

Haughty voice:
Isn't it "obvious" that you can compute it like this:

const double PI = std::acos(-1);

Okay, okay.  What about Euler's number, e

Haughty voice:
Must we tell you EVERYTHING?



or in C++20
