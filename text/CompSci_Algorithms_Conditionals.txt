Conditionals

Are used to help DECIDE what to DO

What property would be useful to help me decide?

How can I find it?

How should I test it?

What should I compare it to?

What should I do after I know the results of the test?

Delete it?
Ignore it?
Change it?
Move it?
Combine it with something else?
Sort it?
Put it in a special place?
etc.

The if Statement

Syntax
if ( conditional-expression ) statement;

if ( conditional-expression ) {
   statements;
}

if ( conditional-expression ) {
   statements;
} else {
   statements;
}

Conditional operators

a < b
a > b
a <= b
a >= b
a == b
a != b


Combining conditional expressions

a && b
a || b

Negation

!a


Complex if statements

Chained if

if ( conditional ){

} else if ( other-conditional ){

} else if ( yet-another-conditional ){

} else {

}

Nested if

if ( conditional ) {
  if (other-conditional) {

  } else {

  }
} else {

}

These are hard to write, and hard to read!

Better solutions
Encapsulate conditional evaluations in functions
Encapsulate branch logic in functions
Encapsulate specific behavior in classes
Use library containers and algorithms
Prefer polymorphic subclasses rather than explicit if/else logic 

You can always inline these
