What is Agile?

A set of techniques and principles for making software development more responsive to changes in need, environment and functionality.

Stated in 2001 at the "Snowbird" meeting

One of the first to address "Values"

Values

The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

Many schools of technique, plenty of books:

SCRUM
eXtreme Programming
Test-Driven Development
etc.
