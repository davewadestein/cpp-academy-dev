Low-level

Interrupt

Triggered by a signal detected at a hardware pinout
Example: ARM architecture provides two Interrupt inputs
Optional hardware can support queuing and prioritization of interrupts from multiple sources

Watchdog timer
Detects if program has a deadlock, or has stopped
Must be reset periodically by application
If not reset, triggers an interrupt


Shared memory
Same memory is mapped to more than one program
Often used for producer/consumer 
Requires synchronization!

Atomic operation - guaranteed uninterruptible, usually takes one clock cycle
HW Semaphore
HW Mutex
