Literals

A Literal value is just a value

Has a type

Has no name

Cannot be changed

Examples

42
98.6
"Can you hear me, Major Tom?"
'X'

Numeric literals

A sequence of decimal digits
[sign][base][value][type]

There are several different numeric types
integer, floating point, double precision
Value may be decorated so compiler respects intended type

Examples:

42U
98.8f
-273.15
3.14159

Numeric values may be expressed in other numeric bases

0b00010111	binary (base 2) starts with 0b
042		Octal (base 8) starts with 0
0x		Hexadecimal (base 16) starts with 0x

Value may 

Character literals

A character is represented by the char data type

char first_letter = 'A';
char last_letter = 'Z';

Literal is a single letter delimited by single quotes

'A'

Some characters are hard to distinguish in the editor
White space characters - space vs. tab
Special 'control' characters - newline vs. return

We represent them with "escape sequences" in character and string literals

Reference: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape

newline	\n'
NULL	\0'
Tab	\t'
Backslash	\\

Example:

Output the string:
I'm Robert O'Malley; just call me "Bob"




Unicode Characters
'u\








String literals

C-style strings

Are represented by the char * data type

char * host_name = "badger";


C++ style strings

Are represented by the std::string library type

#include <string>

std::string ship_name = "Kobayashi Maru";

User-defined literals
