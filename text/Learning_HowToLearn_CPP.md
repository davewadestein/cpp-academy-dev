# How to Learn C++

## Getting yourself and your workspace ready to learn C++

# Programming languages are human languages

## Convey human concerns

## Roots in older languages

## Change over time

## Adopt features of other languages

## Have recognizable periods of use

## Some last a long time

## We take them very personally

# English Language

## Adopts features from Celtic, Latin, Germanic, French etc.		

| Celtic | Root Language |
| Common Brittonic | Ancient |
| Old English | Ancient |
| Middle English | Classical |
| Elizabethan | Early modern |
| Modern | Modern |
| Hipster Ironic | More Modern |

## Some ancient forms survive

### Verily, Thou knowest this to be true.

# C++ Language

## Influences from Java, C#, etc.

| C | Root language
| C with classes |Ancient
| C++98 | Classical |
| C++03 | Classical |
| C++11 | Early modern |
| C++14 | Modern |
| C++17 | More Modern |
| C++20	| Post Modern |

## Some ancient forms survive 

 `x = *(c_ptr + 1)`

# Local dialects

## Conventions

## Usage often constrainted by context (e.g. MISRA rules, "Modern" C++)

## People love to bicker about little things, like indentation

## Hot disagreement over "best" practice, and whether anything else is ever OK (yes)

# Read The Fancy Manuals
You'll be googling a LOT!
With a grain of salt
There's usually several accepted ways to accomplish the same thing
Old C way
Classic C++ way
Modern C++ way
Ask for others' opinions; don't be surprised by strong feelings
Stay calm
Sense of humor
Be adaptable
Be resilient
"Don't be a Jerk"

# C++ is not like other languages

Standardized by testable functionality of source code

Diverse environments and cultures

# You can't just learn the C++ language

## It is an ecosystem of tools and languages

### Toolchain
### Editor(s)
### Command shell(s)
### Git
### Testing tools
### Run-time platforms

# Compartmentalize

## You will have to switch contexts a lot

## Cheatsheets and checklists are good

## Build your environment to help you switch contexts
### Reserve a place to code and study
### Include visual and sensory cues that mark your "study" space
### Use visual cues to distinguish your "coding" apps

### We'll be working together a LOT

# Organize

## Put course materials in a folder that is easy to get to

## Organize labs and handouts by subject

## Name folders and files to help your future self find them

## Organize your physical space

- Room for books, manuals

- Multiple screens are a big help

- Room to stretch

- Room to write

# How to learn it

## Be a Hummingbird
- Sip a lot
- Explore a lot
- Visit your flowers frequently!
- Look at references even when you don't completely understand them

# Learning Language Syntax
## There's a lot of muscle memory here
## Slow down
## Read word by word
## Use it, don't avoid it
## Write some things over and over until they feel right
## Spell out words completely a few times before relying on intellisense


# Consolidate your Memories
## Read and repeat concepts out loud
## Say it in other words
## Try it
## Tell someone else about it

## Take a break
## Sleep on it
## Consult expert viewpoints to understand WHY

# Work with a Net!
## References
## Examples
## Code Management repositories
## Backups
## IntelliSense / Code completion
## Debugger
## Fellow programmers

# Get Comfy

## You'll be doing a LOT of typing

## You'll be doing 10x more reading

## Eat, hydrate, take bathroom breaks

## Stand up and stretch!

## Have some treats nearby

## Get enough sleep

# Ergonomic Setup

## Keyboard and monitor at the right height

## A good keyboard and mouse, easy to hold, tactile feedback

## Large screen(s)

## Big, clear fonts

## Decent lighting

## A comfortable chair

## A pleasant, context-establishing windows theme

## Physical aids

## Reading glasses

## Footrest, armrest

## Keyboard stand

# Be the Protagonist in your Adventure

## Don't be a Hero

It's way too stressful

Hero
Remote and Admirable
Needs superpowers
Has enemies that oppose
Never really fails
Never makes mistakes
Already knows it all
Lives and dies by their power
Often dies tragically, heroically

Protagonist
Close and Understandable
Has human powers
We're all rooting for them
Makes mistakes
Learns by doing
Gets caught up in exciting things and has adventures
Often has happy endings

# Don't Worry
There's plenty for everyone
You can't break the machine in class
You can't break my backup repository
My Rubric is Holistic - you can't fail
Don't be embarrassed
I already made all the mistakes I could think of
I left for you so you woudn't feel left out
Savor your successes

Things you think you'll NEVER get, but you will!
Pointers
Memory management
Thread synchronization
Templates

Make a plan
Plans are Nothing; Planning is Everything. - Ed Repic

WHY HOW WHAT
 
Decide WHAT you want as an end result
Analyze HOW to get it 
Consider WHY you should choose one way over another

# Analyzing a Problem

## Don't start coding immediately
## Go slow
## Take time to Think
## Pick problem apart and think about ONE small, concrete thing
## Draw a sketch or a diagram
## Make a physical model
## Find an analog in human interactions
## Write one tiny function at a time
## See if someone else has solved it already
## Don't worry about "elegant" and "efficient" until you have to
