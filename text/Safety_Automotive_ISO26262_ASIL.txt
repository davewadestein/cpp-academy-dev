Automotive Safety

Safety = Controllability / Risk

Risk = Probability X Severity

Severity

Oddity
Annoyance
Inconvenience
Loss of functionality
Loss of product
Danger to health
Danger to life
Mass Destruction

Probability

Impossible
Eliminated
Rare
Unlikely
Possible
Likely
Certain

You can make a risk matrix:

Everything is Risky

Yes, but...

How much risk can you afford?
In lives and injuries
In dollars
In product functionality
In customer loyalty

Controlling Risk

From hardware to human, we can often control risk

Clear coding standards
Design reviews
Best practices
Factors of safety in design
Extra capacity
Back-up systems
Fail-safe mechanisms
Support infrastructure
Training and skill
Willingness to accept help

"Safety is Job Number One"

Yes, but...

How much Safety can you afford?
Dollars
Time
Infrastructure
Hardware
Materials
People
Complexity

Safety in a Problem Domain

Each domain has its own
Risk classifications
Probability classifications
Mitigation Strategies
Costs

Financial
Aerospace
Automotive
Health and Medicine
Software Development
Security
etc.

There are many specifications
ASIL
ISO
DoD
NASA

Safety for the Automotive Industry

ISO 26262 - Functional Safety for Road Vehicles
Part 9 - Automotive Safety Integrity Level
Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)

Severity
    S0 No Injuries
    S1 Light to moderate injuries
    S2 Severe to life-threatening (survival probable) injuries
    S3 Life-threatening (survival uncertain) to fatal injuries

Exposure
    E0 Incredibly unlikely
    E1 Very low probability (injury could happen only in rare operating conditions)
    E2 Low probability
    E3 Medium probability
    E4 High probability (injury could happen under most operating conditions)

Controllability

    C0 Controllable in general
    C1 Simply controllable
    C2 Normally controllable (most drivers could act to prevent injury)
    C3 Difficult to control or uncontrollable

So S3 E4 C3 is super dangerous

Considerations for ISO 26262 ASIL Hazard Classification

Methodology for determining ASIL specifically
Vehicle motion control systems
Cars up to 3.5 metric tons
OMG, just your average self-driving cars!!
