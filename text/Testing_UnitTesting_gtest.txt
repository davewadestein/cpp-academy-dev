Writing a Unit Test

Arrange-Act-Assert

Arrange
Create an instance of the class to be tested
Create dependent objects and values

Act
Call a function, passing input values

Assert
Check that output values and behavior are "as expected"

This has to be easy and fast, or you won't do it.

Tests must be:

Simple to write
Fast to run
  Unit tests - a few seconds
  Integration tests - a few minutes
Runnable by anyone
Easy to automate
Pass or Fail 

Unit Testing Philosophy

Black Box

White Box
