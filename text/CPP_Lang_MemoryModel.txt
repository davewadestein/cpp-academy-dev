TODO List:

The C++ Memory Model

Fundamental unit is a byte
At least 8 contiguous bits
Uniquely addressable

Available memory
One or more sequences of contiguous bytes

Implementation-dependent
Size of basic data types
Alignment
Binary representation of values

C++11 defines types and values that are more portable
