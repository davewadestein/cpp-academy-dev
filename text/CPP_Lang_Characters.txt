Delimiters

We love us our delimiters:

{ }	Braces, or "Curly Braces"
[ ]	Brackets, or "Square brackets"
< >	"Angle brackets"
( )	Parentheses, or "Parens"
" "	Quotes, or "Double quotes"
Note these are not typesetters matched L/R quotes
' '	Apostrophe, or "Single Quotes"
Note these are not the same as "back quotes" "`"

Delimiters must match and close

We love our special characters, too!

;	Semicolon	end of statement
