IntroductionIn the beginningThere was hardwareThenThere was memoryThenThere was assembly languageThenThere were procedural languages to DO thingsCOBOL, FORTRAN, CThenThere were NON-procedural languages to organize DATASQLThenThere were object-oriented languages... and that's where we came in!This show has been going on for a while, and to enjoy it, you just to dive inI'll give you the backstories as we go alongTrust me, it's a great series.  You'll love it.You can binge the earlier episodes over the weekendsC++A programming languageMulti-paradigmObject-orientedFunctionalImperativeA compiled programming languagePortable by recompilationHigh-levelWants to be Strongly-typed... and, none of that makes any sense at all, does it?<<<<< Rewind.  Reset.Sorry.  Learning a Language is weird. You have to do it before you can talk about it.So, let's write a program.
