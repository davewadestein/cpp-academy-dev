TODO List:

A Lambda is an unnamed function declaration
May be assigned to a variable
Allows code to be passed like data

Syntax:

[ captures ] ( params ) lambda-specifiers requires(optional) { function-body }

Example:  Lambda provides code for a thread

auto code_to_run = []{ // code };
thread t(code_to_run);

A lambda can capture variables that are in scope 
By value
By reference

Therefore, a lambda can use or modify variables in the declaring scope
While being called (with parameters) in another scope

Example: Lambda used to sort objects in a container

You want to keep three things logically separate:
1. The container and its internal organization (linked list, binary tree, etc.)
2. The algorithm that does the sorting
3. The criteria that will be used to compare objects 

Solution:
A standard container
A standard algorithm
A lambda to provide the comparison
