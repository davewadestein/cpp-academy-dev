## Welcome to our C++ Academy!
This will be an immersive class; we are going swimming in the big, big river of C++.  Pack your snacks and sunscreen!  We will be covering a LOT of material, some conceptual and some purely technical.  All of this will be practical in the long run, because it will help you become a good C++ programmer.  

## Primary References

Before, during, and after class, you'll constantly be consulting references, and absorbing material from different points of view.  Here are some key online sources.
